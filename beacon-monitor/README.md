# HF beacon monitor

I am fascinated with the **NCDXF** project as a radio enthusiast. My intention is to create a desktop application which displays the beacons which can be heard at present on a world map. 
Listening to radio waves is done using SDR. I prefer using inexpensive RTL SDR.


# Building

```
cmake .

make
```

You will get the built binary as BeaconMonitorApp.
